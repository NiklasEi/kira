//! Provides an interface for controlling multiple instances
//! and sequences at a time.
//!
//! Groups can be created with [`AudioManager::add_group`](crate::manager::AudioManager::add_group).
//! [`Sound`](crate::sound::Sound)s, [`Arrangement`](crate::arrangement::Arrangement)s
//! and [`Sequence`](crate::sequence::Sequence)s can be assigned
//! to any number of groups when they're created.
//! Groups themselves can also be assigned to groups.
//!
//! [`pause_group`](crate::manager::AudioManager::pause_group),
//! [`resume_group`](crate::manager::AudioManager::resume_group), and
//! [`stop_group`](crate::manager::AudioManager::stop_group) will
//! affect all instances that have the specified group anywhere in
//! their ancestry.
